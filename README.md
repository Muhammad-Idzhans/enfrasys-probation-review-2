/work-challenges
- Only me working on AI (Azure AI Foundry) specifically in my team: No kawan to do work and stress together. A guidance from mentor would be beneficial.
- No real project assigned to me that much. Mostly is just a POC or self-discovery that was asked by Choo Hoong.
- So far currently only me doing things related to development. A guidance/mentor in this field (soft dev) to guide me would be better.

/experience-growth
- Comparison from Day 1 to today.
- Attend vLLM Malaysia day.


/what-next
- Attending again AI-103 exam for certification.


NAPIC (JPPH), also known as National Property Information Centre (Pusat Maklumat Harta Tanah Negara) is ..... Every year or quater of year, they will release their Laporan Stok Harta Tanah. 

These documents where typed manually everytime a new report is being made.

**Zainal Asyraf** approached me and asked me is there any possibilities of the capability to use Azure AI Foundry Generative Model, to generate their report with the exact template.

Due to the inability of the model itself to generate a report on it's own with limited tokens, I come out with a solution where we will use the generative model to only write, translate and also generative HTML version of the report. Then we convert it into PDF, and then convert it to docx for any editing.

The application is using python flask application and deployed at Azure Web App as host.
